# lockscreen
basic app that locks android screen

results in an approx 61K release apk. a previous commit without adaptive icon is only 23K. use that commit if you want the smallest possible apk size

uses accessibility features to lock the screen

includes the required code - but commented out - that can use device admin feature to lock screen but this results in not being able to unlock using biometric alone
